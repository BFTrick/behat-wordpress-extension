# Drivers

The WordPress Extension for Behat provides a range of drivers for interacting with the WordPress site you are testing. A driver represents and manages the connection between the Behat and WordPress environments.

The default driver is `wpcli`. To specify which driver to use for your tests, set [`default_driver`](settings.html) in your `behat.yml` file.

Different drivers support different features:
