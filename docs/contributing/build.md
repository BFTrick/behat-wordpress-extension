# The build process and continuous integration

There are two styles of build which WordHat uses. One is a native build where WordHat, Wordpress, Selenium and other tools are run directly on the native platform. The other is a docker build where docker containers are used to host Wordhat, Wordpress, Selenium and Mysql.
