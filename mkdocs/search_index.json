One of the key features of any online shop is the ability to buy products, but before buying anything, customers need to be able to tell the shop which products they want to buy. We need a shopping basket.\n\n\nWith this, we can create our first user story:\n\n\nFeature:\n Shopping basket\n\n\n    In order to buy products\n\n\n    As a customer\n\n\n    I need to be able to put interesting products into a basket\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we start development, we must have a real conversation with our business stakeholders; they might say that they want customers to not only see the combined price of the products in the basket, but also the price reflecting the tax and the delivery cost (which depends on the total price of the products):\n\n\nFeature:\n Shopping basket\n\n\n    In order to buy products\n\n\n    As a customer\n\n\n    I need to be able to put interesting products into a basket\n\n\n\n    Rules:\n\n\n    - Tax is 20%\n\n\n    - Delivery for basket under \u00a310 is \u00a33\n\n\n    - Delivery for basket over \u00a310 is \u00a32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nFeatures are a simple description of a user story.\n\n\nThe format is always the same: the title of the feature, followed by three lines that describe the benefit, the role, and the feature itself. On subsequent lines, we can add any amount of additional description (such as the rules section, in this example).\n\n\n\n\nIn isolation, each rule by itself is understandable, but there is ambiguous complexity when we try to describe the feature in terms of \nrules\n. For example, what does it mean to add tax? What happens when we have two products, one of which is less than \u00a310, and another one that is more?\n\n\nTo resolve this, we must have another conversation with our business stakeholders. This will often take the form of actual examples of a customer adding products to the basket. After some back-and-forth, we agree upon a list of behaviour examples.\n\n\nIn \nBDD\n, these are called \nScenarios\n.\n\n\nScenarios\n\n\nAfter conversation with our business stakeholders, we came up with the following:\n\n\nFeature:\n Shopping basket\n\n\n    In order to buy products\n\n\n    As a customer\n\n\n    I need to be able to put interesting products into a basket\n\n\n\n    Rules:\n\n\n    - Tax is 20%\n\n\n    - Delivery for basket under \u00a310 is \u00a33\n\n\n    - Delivery for basket over \u00a310 is \u00a32\n\n\n\n    \nScenario:\n Buying a single product under \u00a310\n\n\n        Given \nthere is a \nself-sealing stem bolt\n, which costs \u00a3\n5\n\n\n        \nWhen \nI add the \nself-sealing stem bolt\n to the basket\n\n\n        \nThen \nI should have \n1\n product in the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthe overall basket price should be \u00a3\n9\n\n\n\n    \nScenario:\n Buying a single product over \u00a310\n\n\n        Given \nthere is \nyamok sauce\n, which costs \u00a3\n15\n\n\n        \nWhen \nI add the \nyamok sauce\n to the basket\n\n\n        \nThen \nI should have \n1\n product in the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthe overall basket price should be \u00a3\n20\n\n\n\n    \nScenario:\n Buying two products over \u00a310\n\n\n        Given \nthere is \nyamok sauce\n, which costs \u00a3\n10\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthere is a \nself-sealing stem bolt\n, which costs \u00a3\n5\n\n\n        \nWhen \nI add the \nyamok sauce\n to the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nI add the \nself-sealing stem bolt\n to the basket\n\n\n        \nThen \nI should have \n2\n products in the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthe overall basket price should be \u00a3\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nScenarios in Feature files should focus on the \nwhat\n, rather than the \nhow\n.\n\n\nEach Scenario should be concise and to the point, so that the reader can quickly grasp the intent of the test without having to read a lot of irrelevant steps.\n\n\n\n\nThe totality of the above represents our business\n shared understanding of our project, written in a structured format. It is based on the clear and constructive conversation we had together with our business stakeholders. This, in essence, is what \nBDD\n is.\n\n\nContexts\n\n\nBehat allows us to automate behaviour checks by comparing the prescribed behaviour against a system\ns actual behavior. Before Behat can do this, we need to teach it how to understand our structured language \n otherwise, how is it meant to understand what we mean by \nthen I should have 2 products in the basket\n?\n\n\nContexts are PHP objects that tell Behat how to test Features.
